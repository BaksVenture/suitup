Usage
=====

django-mailer is asynchronous so in addition to putting mail on the queue you
need to periodically tell it to clear the queue and actually send the mail.

The latter is done via a command extension.

Putting Mail On The Queue
=========================
from mailer import send_mail
send_mail(subject, message_body, sender_email , [recipients_emails], [attachments])

Clear Queue With Command Extensions
===================================

With mailer in your INSTALLED_APPS, there will be two new manage.py commands
you can run:

`send_mail` will clear the current message queue. If there are any
failures, they will be marked deferred and will not be attempted again by
`send_mail`.

`retry_deferred` will move any deferred mail back into the normal queue
(so it will be attempted again on the next `send_mail`).

To run these commands automatically use cron
